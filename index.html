## Little bit about me:
Linux Administrator I at Rackspace with aspirations of getting into the wonderful world of DevOps! Always have a project to be working on and always trying to improve methodology for developing script. Really dig DevOps teams with a desire to grow, collaborate, and teach to those who are passionate about learning what it takes, documenting it forward, ~~and possibly know the cure for a slight caffeine addiction.~~
